Junde Liu received his PhD degree in condensed matter physics from the Institute of Physics, the Chinese Academy of Sciences in June 2024. He mainly focus on studying photo-induced phase transition in two-dimensional quantum materials by using time-resolved ARPES. He is also interested in developing novel deep-learning method to enhance the quality of spectral data.
