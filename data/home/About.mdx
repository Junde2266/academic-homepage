Junde Liu will join Professor Mathias's group at the University of GÃ¶ttingen in August 2024. His research primarily focuses on the non-equilibrium dynamics in low-dimensional materials based on time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. He received his PhD in condensed matter physics from the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in June 2024. During his doctoral studies, he concentrated on photo-induced hidden states in quantum materials. Additionally, he is interested in developing novel deep-learning methods to enhance the quality of spectral data.
