Junde Liu joined Professor Mathias's group at the University of GÃ¶ttingen in 2024. His research primarily focuses on the non-equilibrium dynamics and photo-induced phase transition in low-dimensional materials based on time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. He received his PhD in condensed matter physics from the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in June 2024. During his doctoral studies, his main work involved designing and building HHG-based and laser-based time-resolved ARPES setups. Utilizing these experimental techniques, he investigated the photo-induced hidden state in the strongly correlated material 1T-TaS2 and topological phase transition in the topological insulator ZrTe5. In addition, he developed a novel deep-learning method to enhance the quality of spectral data, enabling the acquisition of higher-quality data more efficiently.
