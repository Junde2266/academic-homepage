## Removal of noise and grid structure from ARPES spectra via deep learning method

Developed a novel method to improve spectral data quality using deep learning techniques. By applying this method to the spectra processing, the scientists will be able to overcome instrument limitations and obtain higher-quality data more efficiently, which can contribute to discovering detailed physical features. Based on the low-dimensional structure in the high-dimensional data, a novel spectra-processing algorithm is designed to achieve the effect of removing the extrinsic structure such as noise, grid, and spurious signal by using the correlation information of the data itself without the need for the training set, thus has better robustness and universality, which has wide application in the field of spectra processing.
