## Design and construction of HHG-based and laser-based time-resolved ARPES

Designed and built an ARPES system, including an ultra-high vacuum analysis and sample processing system, a fast sample loading and sample transferring system, a helium lamp ultraviolet light source, and a six-axis low-temperature manipulator; Designed and built an extreme ultraviolet light source based on HHG in rare gases, including the generation, monochrome, analysis and focus process; The combination of the coherent pump-probe light source and the ultra-high vacuum ARPES system was designed and achieved, including vacuum differential, the temporal and spatial overlap of the pump-probe laser at the analyzer focal position; The control program of the system and the linkage between the analyzer SES and program of delay stage were written based on LabView and C++; The program for data processing and analysis was written based on Igor Pro, including data loading, data visualization, data transformation, and data model fitting and analysis.

Designed and constructed time-resolved ARPES based on femtosecond deep-ultraviolet coherent light source by using nonlinear optical crystal (LBO/BBO/KBBF), including the generation of a deep-ultraviolet coherent laser, pulse width compression based on the concave multi-pass focal cavity, dual-pump coherent light source and Pockels cell-based pulse picking module; Designed and implemented the connection between the atmospheric pressure
optical path and ultra-high vacuum ARPES system.
