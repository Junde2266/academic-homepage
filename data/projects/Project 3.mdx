## Electronic structure study of the hidden state in the strongly correlated system 1T-TaS2

1T-TaS2, a strongly correlated material with rich physical properties such as charge density wave, Mott phase, interlayer order, and superconductivity, has received close attention from researchers recently. In particular, 1T-TaS2 can be induced and modulated by ultrashort pulsed laser and electric pulses to the hidden state that cannot be reached in equilibrium. We use the ultrafast laser and time-resolved ARPES to characterize the electronic structure before and after excitation to further understand the mechanism of the transition. At the same time, we increase the efficiency of the writing or erasing process through modulation by pressure, doping, and thinning, thus providing the possibility of ultrafast optical devices.
